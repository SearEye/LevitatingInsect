FlyPy ‚Äì Levitating Insect Camera + Stimulus Rig

Unified GUI to trigger and record from two high-speed cameras (FLIR/Point Grey via PySpin or generic USB via OpenCV), drive lights, and present a looming ‚Äúfalling object‚Äù stimulus. Designed for fruit fly (Drosophila) escape experiments.

Repo: https://github.com/SearEye/LevitatingInsect

Main app: FlyAPI.py (PyQt5 GUI)
Latest tested version: v1.35.4 (Windows 10/11, Python 3.10)

Highlights (v1.35.4)

‚úÖ Dual camera capture with per-camera backend selection: PySpin (Spinnaker) or OpenCV

‚úÖ Device picker shows PySpin cameras by DeviceSerialNumber (e.g., 24102007, 24102017) ‚Äì opens the correct camera

‚úÖ Previews are optional (off by default). Full-resolution, high-FPS recording regardless of preview state

‚úÖ Advanced camera settings (toggle panel): ROI (W/H), Exposure (¬µs), Hardware trigger (Line0)

‚úÖ Looming stimulus (black dot on white) with start/end size, duration, screen selector, fullscreen toggle

‚úÖ Simulation mode (timer-based triggers) for bench testing

‚úÖ Max FPS probe utility

‚úÖ Robust logging to Desktop\LevitatingInsect-main\logs with start/stop timestamps

‚úÖ Handles common PySpin quirks:

‚ÄúCamera is already streaming‚Äù is auto-suppressed

Keeps a process-lifetime Spinnaker System instance to avoid ReleaseInstance crashes

Quick start (Windows)
1) Install prerequisites

Python 3.10 (64-bit) recommended

FLIR Spinnaker SDK + PySpin (for Blackfly etc.)

Install Spinnaker SDK (64-bit)

Ensure these folders are on your PATH (example):

C:\Program Files\FLIR Systems\Spinnaker\bin64\

C:\Program Files\FLIR Systems\Spinnaker\bin64\vs2015\ (or your compiler subfolder)

PySpin is provided by the SDK installer (wheel). Verify with python -c "import PySpin; print('ok')"

OpenCV & PyQt5 and friends:

From the repo root:

py -3.10 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Tip: If you only use USB webcams, you can skip Spinnaker/PySpin.

2) Run

Double-click FlyPy_RunOnly.bat or:

.venv\Scripts\python.exe FlyAPI.py


Optional flags:

--simulate : run without hardware, timer-based triggers

--prewarm-stim : open the stimulus window at launch

Camera 0 / Camera 1 panels (independent)

Backend: OpenCV or PySpin

Device: list of detected devices

PySpin devices appear as: PySpin <DeviceSerialNumber> ‚Äî <Model>

ROI Width/Height (0 = max)

Exposure (¬µs)

Show Preview (off by default)

Driver-reported FPS (approximate) label

Important: The two camera panels must reference different devices (e.g., PySpin serial 24102017 vs 24102007, or different OpenCV indices). Use Refresh Cameras after plugging in devices.

Recording & Output

Each trigger (manual or from the hardware/CH340/UNO) creates:

FlyPy_Output/<YYYYMMDD>/trial_<timestamp>/
  cam0.<ext>
  cam1.<ext>


Container/codec follows your ‚ÄúVideo format / codec‚Äù choice. MJPG in AVI is the most robust for very high FPS.

A CSV trials_log.csv is kept at the root of FlyPy_Output with the per-trial config and file paths.

Logging

Session logs go to:

C:\Users\Murpheylab\Desktop\LevitatingInsect-main\logs\
    FlyPy_run_<START>.log.tmp
    FlyPy_run_<START>__ENDED_<END>.log


On clean or crash exit, the .tmp file is renamed with an __ENDED_<timestamp> suffix.

Triggers & Lights

The app can talk to an Elegoo/UNO (CH340) over serial for MARK START/END and LIGHT ON/OFF.

If no CH340/UNO is found, it simulates those messages and you can still run full trials.

Recommended FPS for Drosophila escape (wings)

To capture wing kinematics during escape, we recommend ‚â• 750 fps (ideally 750‚Äì1000 fps).

If only onset/timing is required (not detailed wing motion), you can go lower; for full wingbeat envelopes, go higher.

Troubleshooting
Both previews show the same camera

Ensure distinct devices are selected:

PySpin: set different serials (e.g., 24102017 and 24102007)

OpenCV: set different indices (e.g., 0 and 1)

Click Refresh Cameras, then re-assign.

If you only have one physical device connected, the other panel may show ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù.

PySpin warning on exit:

Spinnaker: Can't clear an interface because something still holds a reference [-1004]

The app keeps a process-lifetime Spinnaker System to avoid mid-run releases.

If you still see this at exit, it‚Äôs benign. If cameras don‚Äôt re-enumerate across runs, unplug/replug or power-cycle.

BeginAcquisition: Camera is already streaming

Now handled once internally. If image retrieval still fails, call Refresh Cameras or power-cycle that camera.

OpenCV warnings: DSHOW/MSMF ‚Äúcan‚Äôt be used to capture by index‚Äù

Try a different index or use the PySpin backend for FLIR cameras.

Video writer warnings: ‚Äúwrite frame skipped / expected 1 channel but got 3‚Äù

The app writes color frames; this warning appears with odd system ffmpeg builds but files still save.
Switch to AVI/MJPG if you hit reliability issues.

Stimulus window errors on move/resize

If the second monitor is added/removed while running, re-select the target screen and Apply Settings.

Performance tips

Disk throughput matters at >500 fps. Use SSD/NVMe and MJPG AVI if stability is a concern.

Keep previews off during experiments to save CPU/GPU; recording is full-res regardless.

Use the Max FPS probe (3 s) to set Target FPS to ~90% of measured for stability.
