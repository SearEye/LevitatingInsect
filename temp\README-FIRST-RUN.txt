FlyPy â€” Temp Assets
====================

This folder ships with the portable app for convenience.

1) If your Elegoo/CH340 board is not recognized on Windows,
   run: temp\scripts\install_drivers.bat
   (This launches the official WCH CH340/CH341 USB-serial driver installer.)

2) You can delete this folder after installing drivers; it is not
   required for FlyPy to run.
